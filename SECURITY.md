# Security Policy

- Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories.
- Avoid filing public issues for sensitive reports.
- We aim to triage within 7 days.

## Hardening Highlights
- FileLock-based concurrency control
- Pydantic config validation
- Prompt input/output scanning (optional `llm-guard`)
- Configured token/length limits
